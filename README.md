# Python_Challenge
This repo is for week 3 module python challenge.
It conatins all the required files within the Starter_Code folder, it includes source csv data, main.py files for each task respectively and the exported .txt analysis file.

Thoughts on doing this challenge:
for completing the pyband and pypoll task. I used the csv modules to handeling files and learned the os modules to obtain the required file diretory while processing and exporting. I mainly use for loop to parse the data and using list with index slicing to get the data I need. Also, I learned dictionary to solve some problems that could be more cumbersome whem using list only. 

Some resources I used for completing the assignment, (the majority of my knowledge for solveing the assignment was from the interactive online learning from runestone academy):
